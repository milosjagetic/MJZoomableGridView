A view for displaying a zoomable coordinate grid. Grid is rendered with more details as it's zoomed in, or rendered with less details as it's zoomed out.   
Made using `CATiledLayer`. Rendered in a grid of tiles, each tile asynchronously on a separate thread.

## Features
- Customizable origin position. ✅
- Customizable axes' line color, width and dash patterns ✅
- Customizable other line's color, width and dash patterns by specifing `divisor` ✅
- Customizable line spacing ✅
- Customizable axis' line label attributes, format and position insets ✅
- Separate axis scale customization ✅
- Dash pattern rounded caps (experimental) ✅

## Planned
- Skippable lines 💤
- Axis label orientation 💤
- Labels on all other lines 💤

## Usage
- Add `ZoomableGridView` to your view hierarchy
- Customize via `gridProperties` (See `GridProperties` documentation for more details), `minimumZoomScale` and `maximumZoomScale`.
- Zoom your own views alongside the grid view by adding them to `gridContainerView`
